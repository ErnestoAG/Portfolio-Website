# Portfolio-Website

## Description

The goal of this web page is to give employers a preview of projects that I have done and my background information. I used a reset css file from class and some external images. Here are some important points to notice: 

* The website has a header with title and links to content.
* The website implements images that do not belong to me and where retrieved from the internet; they are open access and are compiled in websites.
* Links in the sections allow users to navigate the page and see a different website.
* I used some placeholders since I don't have too much experience yet.
* I implemented media queries to comply with responsive design; however, this site was designed on a 1366x768 monitor, and higher resolutions might cause problems.
* Reffer to the code notes to see each section's functionality and how style was applied.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Left click on the header links to navigate to the specified section. Use the link on the big image to navigate to the website on the preview. Use the "Back to top" link to return to the list of contents.

## Credits

I would like to thank W3 Schools and MDN for the invaluable information they provided me with while I was coding the project. Also, thanks to the creator of the useful web page "A Complete Guide to Flexbox" and my acknowledgement to those who released to the internet the images I used for my project. I also thank the developer behind the Horiseon website, it inspired me to implement parallel sections going from top to bottom and helped me to understand some code functionality.
